import glob


The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order. 

In Python, the glob module is used to retrieve files/pathnames matching a specified pattern. The pattern rules of glob follow standard Unix path expansion rules. It is also predicted that according to benchmarks it is faster than other methods to match pathnames in directories. With glob, we can also use wildcards ("*, ?, [ranges]) apart from exact string search to make path retrieval more simple and convenient.
